## Hi, I'm Gitty 👋
Software Developer | Systems & Developer Tools | Performance | Open Source

I build practical, production-ready systems with a strong focus on performance, clean architecture, and developer experience.

### What I do
- GenAI & AI agents tooling (MCP, GitHub integrations, diagram/visualization workflows)
- LLM inference performance optimization (GPU-oriented, parallel programming mindset)
- Clean, maintainable architecture with strong testing and reliability practices

### Featured work
- **Mermaid MCP Server** — MCP server that turns local folders or GitHub repos into Mermaid diagrams and renders PNG/SVG via Kroki.  
  Clean layered architecture (Tools/Core/Clients/Sources), Source Factory, validation & unified error handling.
- **llama.cpp Performance Acceleration** — SYCL-based GPU operators (SET, ARANGE), kernel redesign with major speedups, and upstream contributions.  
  Also implemented infrastructure-level Sparse-K Attention to reduce attention complexity.

### Highlights
- 4× speedup (ARANGE operator) after kernel redesign & benchmarking
- 2.3× speedup in prompt evaluation without accuracy loss
- Open-source: merged PR into `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`
